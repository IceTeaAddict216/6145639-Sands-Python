# Signals and Systems
This repository contains scripts to generate and visualise basic signals and to modify them. It is for the course Signals and Systems AESB2122-24 from the Applied Earth Sciences program at TU Delft.

## Description
Python functions are provided to create standard signals such as sine waves, sinc, unit step and unit pulse functions. These are then plotted and modified (time scaling/shifting, addition and multiplication).

## Structure
* ```signals.py```-Library with defined functions
* ```run.py```-Script that plots and modifies the signals
* ```hellooo.py```-A very kind print statement C:
* ```README.md```-Project documentation

## How to use
1. Install dependencies NumPy and Matplotlib:
    ```pip install numpy matplotlib```
2. Run the function with the neccesary arguments:
    ```python run.py```
    This will open plots for each generated signal
